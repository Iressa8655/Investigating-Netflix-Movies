# 🎬 Investigating Netflix Data  
A Python-based exploratory data analysis of Netflix movie data to understand trends in release years, durations, and genres.

---

## 🧠 Project Description  
This project analyses a curated dataset of Netflix titles. Using Python, pandas and Matplotlib, I explored patterns in movie durations, genre frequencies, and release trends over time.

Key questions explored:

- Which years had the most Netflix movie releases?  
- How do movie durations vary?  
- Are certain genres more common?  

This is a guided DataCamp project designed to practise real-world EDA workflows.

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Data cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Filtering, grouping, summarising datasets

## 📁 Data  
The dataset was provided by **DataCamp** as part of their guided project:  
**“Investigating Netflix Data.”**

It includes variables such as:

- Title  
- Release year  
- Genre  
- Duration  
- Category (Movie / TV Show)

---

## 📜 Key Steps

- Load and inspect dataset (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`)  
- Select Netflix **movies** only  
- Visualise movie duration trends  
- Identify peak release years  
- Analyse genre distributions  
- Generate and interpret summary plots

## 📈 Findings (Summary)

- Movie durations vary widely, but most cluster around standard feature-length times.  
- Certain years show noticeably higher movie output, reflecting Netflix’s growth.  
- Genres such as drama and documentary appear most frequently.  
- Duration trends across years help identify outliers and interesting patterns.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add more advanced visualisation (boxplots, KDE plots).  
- Compare patterns between Movies vs. TV Shows.  
- Analyse genre changes across years.  
- Explore whether duration relates to release year or genre.
